					<p>When i was Senior high another challenge arise,I was diagnosed that i have a lungs problem. I always go to hospital for check up and examination.Having a x ray 3 times a month is not easy because it's dangerous. My health really become weaker and weaker,even my mental issue drop too.I loat hope and I thought that I would die,I thought that maybe i survive in my surgery but not in my health problem. That's why my parent decided that i stay in cebu for my medication and the good thing is my health issue have a treatment by only taking a medicine but it's not easy to take how many medicine every meal.Our pastor pray for my healing and true indeed that God will answer our prayer,I believe that it  not the medicine that save me but God who truly cleanse me.</p>
